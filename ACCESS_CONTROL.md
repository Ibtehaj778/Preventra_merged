# Access control and hospital dashboards: how it all works

This document explains, step by step, what was built on top of the
*Access Control & Hospital Dashboard Framework*: who can see what, how accounts
get in, and where each piece lives in the code. It starts with the question
that comes up most — **what is the difference between a case manager and a
hospital admin?** — and then walks through each build step in order.

## 1. The one rule everything follows

> **Every account has exactly one role, and belongs to one hospital** (or, for
> insurers, one insurer). The superadmin — our team — is the only exception.

Two consequences run through everything below:

- **The server decides, not the screen.** Hiding a menu item is a courtesy. Every
  API request re-checks who the person is and what they may see, so a hidden
  page cannot be reached by typing its URL, and a refused request never falls
  back to made-up data.
- **Changes take effect immediately.** Both backends re-read the account from the
  database on every request. Approving someone, changing their role or suspending
  them applies to their very next click — nobody has to sign out and back in.

---

## 2. The seven roles

| Role | Who it is | Belongs to | In one sentence |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Superadmin** | Our team | Nobody (sees every hospital) | Sets up hospitals and insurers, can see and fix anything. |
| **Hospital admin** | The person who runs the hospital's account | One hospital | Manages the hospital's people and money; sees patients at overview level. |
| **Case manager** | A care coordinator (often a nurse or social worker) | One hospital | Works on *every* patient in the hospital to keep their care on track. |
| **Doctor** | A treating clinician | One hospital | Works on the patients assigned to them. |
| **Nurse** (includes caretakers) | A nurse or caretaker | One hospital | Follows up the patients assigned to them. |
| **Insurer** | A payer's staff | One insurer | Sees its own members, in any hospital, mainly costs and outcomes. |
| **Patient** | A patient | One hospital | Sees their own record only. |

The role names are identical everywhere — database, sign-in token, both
backends, both frontends — so there is never a translation between them.

---

## 3. Case manager vs hospital admin

This is the part that looks confusing, because on the menu they look similar:
both see the **whole hospital**, both have an **Overview** page and a **Staff**
page, and both can **assign patients** to doctors and nurses. The difference is
in *what kind of work* each one does.

### The short version

- A **hospital admin** runs the hospital's *account*: people, access and money.
  They look at patients from a distance.
- A **case manager** runs patients' *care*: follow-ups and coordination. They
  work inside individual patient records all day.

### Side by side

| | Hospital admin | Case manager |
|---|---|---|
| **Main job** | Running the account: people, access, money | Coordinating patient care: follow-ups, who looks after whom |
| **Sees which patients** | All of the hospital's | All of the hospital's |
| **Patient list** | Overview only: risk, care team, insurer. **No diagnoses, drivers, vitals or drugs** | Everything, including diagnoses and risk drivers |
| **Opening one patient's clinical details** | **Must give a reason** (care coordination, incident review, audit, billing). It is written to the access log | Opens directly, no reason asked |
| **Adding and approving people** (User Management) | **Yes** — doctors, nurses, case managers, patients, including approving or declining the people who signed up for their hospital | No |
| **Access log** | **Can read** their hospital's log | No |
| **Cost and ROI screens** (GLP-1 Budget Simulator, Cost of Inaction, drug spend) | **Yes** | No |
| **Registering doctors for alerts** (Readmissions) | **Yes** | No |
| **Uploading or adding patients** | **Yes** | No |
| **Assigning doctors and nurses to patients** | Yes | Yes |
| **Adding care notes, answering clinical alerts** | No | **Yes** |
| **Clinician Console** (doctors' alert inboxes) | No | **Yes** |

So they overlap on *seeing the whole hospital* and *assigning*, and are
opposites on everything else: the admin has management and money but only the
outside of patient records; the case manager has the inside of patient records
but no management and no money.

### Why the admin must give a reason and the case manager doesn't

Health data follows a "minimum necessary" principle: people see clinical detail
when their job needs it. A case manager's job *is* the clinical detail — they
cannot arrange a heart-failure follow-up without knowing it is heart failure. A
hospital admin's job usually isn't, so they see the big picture by default, and
when they do need one patient's details (a complaint, an audit, a billing
query) they say why, and it is recorded. That also means misuse is visible in
the access log.

### An example day

- **The hospital admin** adds two new nurses in User Management, approves a
  doctor who signed up, checks drug spend on the GLP-1 Overview, and sees on the
  Readmissions Overview that 12 patients have no doctor assigned. A complaint
  comes in about one patient, so they open that patient with the reason
  *Complaint / incident review*.
- **The case manager** opens the "Needs attention" list, reads each patient's
  diagnoses and risk drivers, assigns the unassigned patients to doctors,
  adds a note after calling a patient, and answers an alert in the Clinician
  Console.

### If you still want them to be more different

The current split follows the framework document exactly (its table gives case
managers the whole hospital, clinical detail and assignment, but no user
management and no costs). If the team wants a sharper difference, the options
are:

| Option | What changes | Effort |
|---|---|---|
| **A. Keep as is** | Nothing. The difference is management and money vs clinical work. | None |
| **B. Give case managers a caseload** | Case managers see only the patients assigned *to them*, like nurses. Admins assign patients to case managers too. | Medium: a case-manager field on each patient, plus assignment UI |
| **C. Rename the role on screen** | Show "Care coordinator" instead of "Case manager", so the purpose is obvious. The code keeps `case_manager`. | Small |
| **D. Merge into hospital admin** | One role. Loses the separation between clinical and admin access. Not recommended. | Medium |

---

## 4. Full permissions table

"Own" means patients assigned to that person. "Hospital" means every patient of
their hospital. The superadmin can narrow any view to one hospital with the
hospital picker.

| What | Superadmin | Hospital admin | Case manager | Doctor | Nurse | Insurer | Patient |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Which patients | All hospitals | Hospital | Hospital | Own | Own | Own members | Own record |
| Overview page | Yes | Yes | Yes | — | — | Yes (members) | — |
| Patients list | Yes | Overview layer | Yes | Yes | Yes | Overview layer | — |
| Clinical details of a patient | Yes (logged) | With reason (logged) | Yes | Yes | Yes | With reason (logged) | Own |
| Staff page | Yes | Yes | Yes | — | — | — | — |
| Assign doctors / nurses | Yes | Yes | Yes | — | — | — | — |
| Add notes, answer alerts | Yes | — | Yes | Yes | Yes | — | — |
| Clinician Console | Yes | — | Yes | Own inbox | — | — | — |
| Add / upload patients | Yes | Yes | — | — | — | — | — |
| Register doctors for alerts | Yes | Yes | — | — | — | — | — |
| GLP-1 cost and ROI screens | Yes | Yes | — | — | — | Yes (members) | — |
| User Management | Everyone, and every sign-up | Own hospital's staff and patients, and the sign-ups asking to join it | — | — | — | — | — |
| Create hospitals and insurers | Yes | — | — | — | — | — | — |
| Access log | All hospitals | Own hospital | — | — | — | — | — |
| Forecast sweep | Yes | — | — | — | — | — | — |

"Overview layer" = patient number, risk score and band, trend, discharge date,
care team and insurer. The clinical layer = diagnoses, risk drivers, vitals
(BMI, HbA1c, age), drug, pharmacy, notes and alerts.

## 5. Step 1 — Roles become real

**Before:** anyone signing up typed their own role ("Doctor", even "superadmin")
and their own hospital name, and nothing checked either. The Readmissions API
only checked a shared key that ships inside the public website, and most GLP-1
routes checked nothing at all. GLP-1 had a role toggle anyone could flip.

**What changed:**

1. **A fixed list of seven roles** (section 2). The database rejects any other
   value once `scripts/migrate_user_roles.py` has run.
2. **Every account has a status**, `pending` or `active`, and a `hospital_id`.
   Pending accounts can sign in, but see a "waiting for approval" screen and get
   no data.
3. **Every API route requires an active, signed-in user** — all of Readmissions'
   routes and all of GLP-1's. A route added later is covered automatically: the
   check is attached to the whole app, not route by route.
4. **The account is re-read on every request**, so changes apply at once (see
   section 1). The sign-in token's contents are for display only.
5. **Old accounts are not trusted.** An account created before this has whatever
   role its owner typed, so it is treated as an active case manager with no
   hospital until an admin places it.
6. **The first superadmin** is created with `scripts/create_superadmin.py`, run
   by someone with database access. No web page can create or grant superadmin.
7. **GLP-1's role toggle is gone.** The role shows read-only. The "Clinician"
   badge became "Care team".

---

## 6. Step 2 — Hospitals, insurers and User Management

**What changed:**

1. **Hospitals and insurers are records** (`shared_identity.hospitals` and
   `shared_identity.insurers`). Only the superadmin creates them. A hospital's id
   is made from its name, e.g. "Demo Hospital" → `demo-hospital`.
2. **User Management** — one section, shown in GLP-1's Settings page and on
   Readmissions' "User Management" page. The same accounts work in both apps.
   - The **superadmin** creates hospitals, insurers and hospital admins, and can
     manage every account except other superadmins.
   - A **hospital admin** adds and manages doctors, nurses, case managers and
     patients, only in their own hospital. They cannot create another hospital
     admin, and cannot see other hospitals' accounts at all.
3. **Temporary passwords.** A person added by an admin gets a 12-character
   temporary password, shown to the admin once. At first sign-in the Portal makes
   them choose their own; until they do, both apps refuse them data.
4. **CSV import.** Many staff at once: a file with the columns `email,name,role`
   (up to 1,000 rows). Each row succeeds or fails on its own.
5. **Suspend** puts an account back to pending, which cuts it off immediately.

---

## 7. Step 3 — Every patient belongs to a hospital

**What changed:**

1. **Each patient has an ownership record** saying which hospital they belong
   to, who their insurer is, their doctor, their nurses, and (for patient
   accounts) which login is theirs.
   - Readmissions keeps it on each patient's `care_actions` record.
   - GLP-1 keeps it in a `patient_access` collection, one per patient (plus the
     patient's pharmacy).
   - Both survive the data being reloaded.
2. **Every patient API is filtered** to the patients the person may see
   (section 4, first row). Asking for someone else's patient returns
   **"not found"** — the same answer as for a patient that does not exist, so
   nobody can find out which patients another hospital has.
3. **Headline numbers are the caller's own.** Summaries, counts and cost figures
   are worked out from the caller's patients, not the whole population.
4. **Both chatbots are scoped the same way**, and a chatbot conversation belongs
   to the account that started it.
5. **GLP-1 cost and ROI screens** are for the superadmin, hospital admins and
   insurers only.
6. **The seed script** `Readmissions/scripts/seed_hospital.py` puts the demo data
   into one hospital, sets insurers from the data, and can create demo accounts
   with assignments (section 11).

---

## 8. Step 4 — The hospital dashboards

**What changed, page by page (both apps):**

1. **Overview** — "How is my hospital doing?"
   - Readmissions: patients, high risk (and the change since last batch), needs
     attention, open alerts, patients with no doctor or no nurse, recent
     discharges, insurer mix.
   - GLP-1: patients on therapy, adherent vs not, high dropout risk, drug mix,
     insurer mix, and — for cost roles only — drug spend. The segment charts
     below it are the existing Executive Summary.
   - Every figure you can act on opens the Patients list already filtered.
   - Doctors and nurses have no Overview; they start on their Patients list.
   - **Reeha's change:** in GLP-1 the hospital summary box is hidden for the
     superadmin, because Talha's dashboard below already covers it. Hospital
     admins, case managers and insurers still see it.
2. **Patients** — one row per patient with their doctor, nurses and insurer.
   Admins and case managers can tick patients and **assign a care team** in one
   go. The doctor or nurse sees their new patients on their next click.
3. **Patient detail** — for hospital admins and insurers, the overview first,
   then the **reason prompt** (section 3). The reason is logged once per patient
   per sign-in; signing in again asks again.
4. **Staff** — every doctor and nurse with how many patients they have and how
   many of those are high risk, plus open alerts (Readmissions) or non-adherent
   patients (GLP-1). Click a person to see
   their patients. In Readmissions, a doctor must be registered for alerts (with
   a specialty) before patients can be assigned to them; admins do that with a
   button on this page.
5. **Access log** — a section at the bottom of User Management: who opened which
   patient, in which app, when, and why. A hospital admin sees their hospital's
   log (including our team's and insurers' views of their patients); the
   superadmin sees everything.
6. **Hospital picker** — the superadmin can switch to one hospital and see
   exactly what its admin sees, or "All hospitals". Nobody else can use it.
7. **No more made-up numbers in GLP-1.** Pages used to show sample data while
   loading or after an error; now they show a loading state or the real error.

---

## 9. Step 5 — Choosing a role and hospital at sign-up

**Why:** Reeha suggested people pick their role at sign-up, so the admin can see
at a glance who is waiting to join as what. Then, so that our team does not have
to place every new doctor, nurse and patient by hand, people also pick **their
hospital**, and **that hospital's admin approves them**. Both are only a
**request**: nobody gets into a hospital by choosing it.

**What changed:**

1. **The Portal's "Create account" form asks two things:**
   - **"I am joining as"**: Doctor, Nurse or caretaker, Case manager, Hospital
     administrator, Insurer, Patient. Picking one shows a one-line explanation
     underneath, so people choose correctly. Superadmin is never offered, and
     the server refuses it even if someone sends it directly.
   - **"Your hospital"**, for the roles that work for a hospital (everything
     except insurer): a list of the hospitals on the platform, plus **"My
     hospital isn't listed"**. The list shows names only — but it is public:
     anyone opening the sign-up page can see which hospitals use Preventra.
2. **The account is pending and in no hospital** until someone approves it. It
   sees no patient data. The request is kept on the account (`requested_role`,
   `requested_hospital_id`).
3. **The waiting screen** says, for example, "You asked to join Demo Hospital as:
   Nurse. Its administrator will review your request."
4. **The hospital admin decides** (User Management):
   - A yellow banner says how many people have signed up to join their hospital.
     **Review** shows them.
   - Each request reads "Signed up as Nurse for Demo Hospital", with
     **Approve** and **Decline**. The admin can change the role before approving
     (among the roles they may give: doctor, nurse, case manager, patient).
   - **Approve** puts the person in the hospital and activates them; their next
     click works. **Decline** takes the request off the hospital's list; the
     account stays pending, and the superadmin can still place it elsewhere.
   - A hospital admin only ever sees requests for **their own** hospital, and
     cannot approve someone who asked to join a different one — not even by
     typing their email into "Add a person".
5. **Requests to become a hospital admin go to the superadmin only.** One
   hospital admin cannot make another.
6. **The superadmin keeps full control.** They see every request, filter them by
   status and role, and each request's hospital is already filled in, so
   approving is one click. They can also change the role or hospital, decline,
   or place people who chose "My hospital isn't listed" and insurers, who pick no
   hospital.

---

## 10. How a new person gets in, end to end

### A. They sign up themselves (the normal way now)

1. On the Portal they choose **Create one**, enter email and password, pick
   **I am joining as** and **Your hospital**.
2. They land on **"Your account is waiting for approval"**, which names the
   hospital they asked to join.
3. **Their hospital's admin** opens User Management, sees the banner, clicks
   **Review**, then **Approve** (or **Decline**). The superadmin can do the same
   for any hospital.
   - Asked to be a **hospital admin**, or chose **"My hospital isn't listed"**,
     or is an **insurer**: only the superadmin approves them, choosing the
     hospital or insurer.
4. The person clicks **Check again** (or signs in again) and sees their apps.
   They keep the password they chose.

### B. An admin adds them

1. The hospital admin (or superadmin) opens User Management → **Add a person**,
   enters the email, name and role.
2. The screen shows a **temporary password** once. The admin passes it on
   privately.
3. The person signs in on the Portal, is asked to **set their own password**,
   and then sees their apps.

If the email belongs to someone who already signed up for this hospital, "Add a
person" approves them instead of creating a second account.

---

## 11. Demo data and demo accounts

- Readmissions uses MIMIC patients; GLP-1 uses its existing dataset. Both are
  placed in one demo hospital by `seed_hospital.py`.
- Running the seed with `--with-demo-accounts` creates these logins, all with the
  password typed when the seed was run:

| Account | Role |
|---|---|
| `admin@<hospital-id>.test` | Hospital admin |
| `casemanager@<hospital-id>.test` | Case manager |
| `nurse1@…`, `nurse2@…` | Nurses (patients split between them) |
| `cardiology@…`, `pulmonology@…`, `endocrinology@…`, `medicine@…` | Doctors (patients assigned by condition) |
| `claims@medicare.test`, `claims@medicaid.test`, `claims@private.test`, `claims@other.test` | Insurers |
| `patient1@…`, `patient2@…` | Patients, each linked to one record |

- `demo_patient_logins.py --hospital "<name>"` puts **every** Readmissions patient
  in that hospital (moving any from another hospital, with that hospital's doctor
  and nurses taken off them and this hospital's given instead), and makes
  `patient1@…` to `patient20@…`, each linked to one current patient: high,
  medium and low risk in turn, across conditions. They sign in to Readmissions
  only and land on their own record. All of them, including the two above, get
  the password typed when it runs. `--dry-run` shows the list first.

Demo accounts share one known password. Change it, or remove them, before anyone
outside the team gets a link — real MIMIC data sits behind them.

## 13. What is not built yet

| Item | Status |
|---|---|
| Deactivate and delete accounts | "Suspend" (back to pending) exists; a proper deactivate and a superadmin-only delete do not. |
| Email invites | Admins hand over temporary passwords for now; invites need an email service. |
| Telling a declined person why | A declined account just stays waiting; the Portal does not yet say it was declined. |
| Forecast sweep per hospital | Superadmin only, because it currently scans every hospital at once. |
| BMI and HbA1c over time (GLP-1) | Needs repeated measurements; the data has one snapshot per patient. |

Open questions for the team:

- Is the reason list right (care coordination, complaint / incident review,
  audit, billing query)?
- Should case managers stay as they are, or change (section 3, options A–D)?
- Email invites instead of temporary passwords, once there is an email service?
