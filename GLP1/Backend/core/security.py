"""
Who is making this request: the dependency every GLP-1 /api route runs.

This service never issues tokens - the Readmissions API does, for both
products. Here the token only proves identity. The account is then read from
`shared_identity.users` on every request, so an approval, a role change or a
removal made by an admin applies to the very next request, not when the token
expires.
