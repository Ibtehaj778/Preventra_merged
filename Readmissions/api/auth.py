"""Shared login: the service that issues tokens for both products.

One account works across GLP-1 and Readmissions. This module owns the identity
side of that: it stores accounts in `shared_identity.users` on the shared
cluster, checks passwords, and signs a JWT that either product can verify on its
own with the same secret.

Issuing lives in exactly one place - here. Each product verifies independently
and never calls back, which is what keeps the two backends separately
deployable. A second service that also issued tokens would put us back to two
logins, which is the problem this replaces.

Compatibility matters: accounts already exist in that collection, created
elsewhere with bcrypt at cost 12 (`$2b$12$`, 60 chars). The hashing here matches,
so those accounts keep working and nobody has to reset a password.

Token claims, frozen by agreement between both products:

    {"sub": "<users._id as a string>", "email": ..., "role": ..., "status": ...,
     "hospital_id": ..., "must_change_password": <bool>,
     "app_access": ["glp1", "readmissions"], "exp": <unix>}

The claims are for display only. Both backends re-read the account on every
request (see `authenticate`), so an approval, a role change or a removal takes
effect on the next request, not when the token runs out.
