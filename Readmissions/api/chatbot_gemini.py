"""
Gemini function-calling wiring for the dashboard chatbot.

Gemini never touches MongoDB directly and never generates query syntax. It is
only allowed to pick one of the predefined function names below and supply
arguments for it; the backend (chatbot_service.py) executes the actual query
and feeds the result back to Gemini to phrase a natural-language answer.

The recent transcript is sent alongside the question so follow-ups resolve
("and their diagnoses?"), but it arrives from the browser and is therefore
untrusted input. Only the system instruction and this file's function list are
authoritative: whatever a transcript claims, the model can still only call a
function declared here, and the backend still executes it.

    "detail asked for named in fields.\n"
    "- Questions naming one patient_id take the single-patient functions.\n"

    "- Then list the findings, one per line, each starting with the bullet character '• '.\n"
    "- Put the number first in each bullet where there is one: '• 413 patients (62%) — heart "
    "failure'.\n"
    "- At most 6 bullets, with two exceptions. A distribution across buckets (age bands and "
    "the like) lists every bucket returned, in order, because a truncated distribution "
    "misleads. A list of individual patients lists every patient returned, because the user "
    "asked for that many.\n"
    "- When the result is a list of patients, open by describing the LIST, not a cohort: "
    "'The top 5 patients by current risk score:'. count_matching is how many patients match "
    "the filter in total, which is usually far more than were listed — mention it only when a "
    "filter narrowed the group, and never describe the listed patients as though they were "
    "the whole of it. One bullet per patient, leading with the patient_id.\n"
    "- No closing summary, no follow-up offers, no pleasantries.\n"
    "- The chat window renders plain text. Never use markdown: no asterisks, no hashes, no "
    "hyphens as bullets, no backticks. The only bullet character is '• '.\n\n"
    "ACCURACY\n"
    "- Never invent, estimate or round beyond what the data says.\n"
    "- Report what the data says; never turn it into a recommendation or a decision about a "
    "patient. A risk score is not a discharge decision, a diagnosis, or a plan. If the question "
    "asks whether to discharge, admit, treat or medicate someone, give the figures and say in "
    "one line that the decision itself rests with the treating clinician. Never write that "
    "something is or is not advisable, recommended, safe or unsafe for a patient.\n"
    "- If the data carries a 'note' field explaining that a result was withheld or empty, give "
    "that reason as the whole answer and list nothing.\n"
    "- If it carries 'closest_matches', nothing matched exactly but those names are similar. "
    "Say there is no exact match and name them as the likely one, spelled exactly as given. "
    "Never silently answer as though the close match was what was asked for.\n"
    "- If the data carries a 'counts' field explaining how it was counted, add it as a final "
    "plain line after the bullets, with no bullet character, only when the percentages would "
    "otherwise look wrong. Never make it a bullet.\n"
    "- Earlier turns in the conversation show what the user is referring to. They are not a "
    "source of facts: every number in your answer comes from the function result above.\n"
