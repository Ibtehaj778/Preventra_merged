"""
Orchestrates a single chatbot turn:
  1. Ask Gemini to select one of the predefined functions + arguments.
  2. Execute that function against MongoDB ourselves (never LLM-generated queries).
  3. Ask Gemini to phrase the result as a natural-language answer.

A question with no function behind it takes a fourth route: if it is about
medicine, readmission or the dashboard it is answered from knowledge under a
separate, tightly-bounded instruction; only genuinely unrelated questions are
refused. The recent transcript rides along with every step so follow-ups
("what about the top 10?") resolve against what was already asked.

Every failure mode is caught here and turned into a clean, user-safe message.
Raw exceptions/stack traces never propagate to the caller.
