"""
The clinician loop: registry, alert routing, and the doctor's response.

THE FLOW
--------
    weekly monitoring  ->  models/early_warning.forecast()
                       ->  create_alert()        one alert per patient per week
                       ->  route()               to a registered doctor
                       ->  doctor's inbox        acknowledge, then respond
                       ->  recommendation        back onto the patient record

WHY A SEPARATE COLLECTION FROM `alerts`
---------------------------------------
`alerts` already exists and means something specific: a coordinator changed a
patient's score by hand and it jumped a band. That is a record of an edit.
These are forecasts addressed to a named clinician, with an acknowledgement and
a reply. Same word, different object, different lifecycle - merging them would
mean one collection whose documents only half make sense whichever way you read
them.

IDENTITY IS A DIRECTORY, NOT AUTHENTICATION
-------------------------------------------
Sign-in was removed from this build. `register_doctor` creates a directory
entry and the console picks one; nothing verifies that the person clicking is
the doctor they selected. That is fine for a demonstration and is NOT fine for
real patient data. Everything here is written so that adding real authentication
later means checking the caller against `doctor_id` at the endpoint - the data
model already carries who did what and when.
