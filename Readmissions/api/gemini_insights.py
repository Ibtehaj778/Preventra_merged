"""
Gemini-powered clinical decision support for a single patient's risk verdict:

  1. Return-on-investment estimate for enrolling the patient in a post-discharge
     care-coordination intervention (cost avoided vs. cost of the intervention).
  2. Counterfactual explanation — which risk driver(s), if addressed, would most
     plausibly lower the score, and roughly by how much.

Gemini is asked to return both as a single structured JSON object (response_schema
enforced) so the API never has to parse free-form text. Only the risk score, band,
and driver list already computed by the model are given to Gemini — it never sees
raw patient identifiers or invents clinical facts beyond what's provided.
