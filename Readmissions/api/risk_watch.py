"""
Which of the caller's patients got worse in their latest monitoring week.

This is what a doctor's bell and the "Needs attention" panel show: their own
patients - access.patient_scope decides whose, exactly as for the patient list -
whose latest weekly score

    carries a red flag       saturation below 90% and the rest of
                             models/monitoring_rules.RED_FLAGS
    rose RISE_POINTS or more the trend panel's noise band: a smaller move is
                             not distinguishable from week-to-week noise
    moved up a risk band     Low -> Medium, Medium -> High

A red flag, or a rise that ends in High, is "urgent"; anything else "rising".
Red flags first, then other urgent rises, then the rest; biggest rise first.

Computed from weekly_monitoring on every call rather than stored as alerts:
the weekly series is regenerated as a whole (scripts/simulate_weekly_monitoring
.py), and a stored alert would then describe weeks that no longer exist. What
IS stored is who has seen which week (SEEN_COLLECTION), so a patient leaves the
bell once opened and comes back only when a newer week rises again.
