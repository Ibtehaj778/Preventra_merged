Early-warning forecast over the weekly monitoring series.

WHAT THIS IS, AND WHAT IT IS NOT
--------------------------------
This is NOT a trained model and does not claim to be one. No public dataset
carries weekly post-discharge observations against readmission outcomes at the
cadence this would need to be fitted - scripts/mimic_feasibility.py measures
that directly against MIMIC's `omr` table and prints the verdict. Fitting a
model to simulated weeks would only learn the simulator.

What this is instead, and what it can honestly claim:

  1. LINEAR PROJECTION of the patient's own observed score series. Arithmetic
     on real numbers. It says where the trend points, not what will happen.

  2. CONDITION-SPECIFIC RED FLAGS on the week's observations, using published
     clinical thresholds - a >2 kg weekly gain in heart failure, SpO2 below 92,
     a temperature over 38 after a sepsis admission. Each flag carries its own
     rationale so a clinician can disagree with it individually.

  3. AN ENGAGEMENT PATTERN read across the non-clinical signals, because a
     patient who has stopped collecting prescriptions and stopped attending
     follow-up is a well-described readmission precursor.

The value is the LEAD TIME. The existing alerting is reactive: it fires once a
score has already crossed into a higher band. This fires while the score is
still Medium and heading for High, or when the vitals show a condition-specific
pattern before the score has moved at all.

ALERTING THRESHOLDS ARE NOT SCORING WEIGHTS
-------------------------------------------
models/monitoring_rules.py answers "how much worse is this week". This module
answers a different question: "is this worth interrupting a clinician for".
Those are different jobs and deliberately have different numbers. A signal can
move the score a little every week without ever being worth a phone call, and a
single reading can be worth a phone call without moving the score much at all.
Keeping the two tables separate is what lets either be tuned without silently
breaking the other.

WHEN THERE IS NOT ENOUGH DATA
-----------------------------
A slope needs at least two points. With one week of monitoring the honest
answer is "not enough history yet", and that is what this returns - not a
projection drawn through a single observation.
