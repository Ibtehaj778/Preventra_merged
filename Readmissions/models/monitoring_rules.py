"""
The post-discharge monitoring rule set.

Shared by two callers so they can never disagree:

  scripts/simulate_weekly_monitoring.py   generates simulated weekly panels
  api/main.py                             scores a real patient's self-logged
                                          vitals and medication adherence

Each rule maps one observed value to (points, phrasings). Points are added to
the patient's calibrated discharge score; positive raises risk, negative lowers
it.

The weights are deliberately ASYMMETRIC - the worst week adds about 27 points
while the best week removes about 6. Deterioration is strong evidence of
trouble; perfect adherence is only weak evidence of safety, since a patient can
take every pill and still decompensate. The trained model behaves the same way:
perturbing its lab inputs across their deteriorating range moved scores +10.2
points on average, while normalising them moved only -1.8.

This is NOT the gradient-boosted model scoring vitals. That model was trained on
discharge-time features and contains no vitals, adherence or pharmacy feature.
This layer is a transparent clinical guardrail over a calibrated ML baseline.

WHY EACH RULE HAS SEVERAL PHRASINGS
-----------------------------------
A rule fires for a whole bucket of values, so a single fixed sentence made every
patient in that bucket read identically - four weeks of cards saying the same
thing about adherence teaches a reader to stop reading them. Each branch now
carries two or three phrasings that say the same clinical thing from a different
angle, and `score_week` picks one from a caller-supplied `variant`. The variant
is derived from patient and week, never drawn at random, so a card does not
reword itself on refresh.

The POINTS are unaffected by the variant. Only the prose changes.

WHERE THE NUMBERS COME FROM
---------------------------
See SIGNAL_FEEDS. Each signal is attributed to a named upstream feed - a home
device hub, a medication app, a retail pharmacy, a clinic scheduling system -
because "adherence 62%" is a different fact depending on whether a patient typed
it or a pharmacy dispensing record produced it.

Those feed names are FICTIONAL and generated deterministically from the patient
id. No such integration exists yet; this is the shape the cards will have when
it does.

# logging form: a patient with chronic lung disease should be sending oxygen
# saturations and can skip the scales, and the form should say so.
