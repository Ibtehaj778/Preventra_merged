Weekly post-discharge monitoring for the Preventra dashboard.

WHAT THIS IS
------------
A post-discharge monitoring programme does not re-draw a full inpatient lab
panel every week. What it actually records is:

    vitals              weight, blood pressure, heart rate, oxygen saturation
    medication adherence proportion of prescribed days actually covered
    pharmacy activity   was the refill due this week collected
    follow-up           was the post-discharge appointment attended

Those are the things a care coordinator can see, act on, and change. So those
are what the weekly cards show and what moves the weekly score.

HOW THE SCORE IS BUILT
----------------------
    week 0  the REAL calibrated model's discharge probability over 94 features,
            explained with REAL SHAP attribution. Unchanged.

    week n  that discharge baseline, adjusted by the monitored signals for the
            week through the explicit, bounded rules in SIGNAL_RULES below,
            plus a carry term so an unresolved problem keeps compounding
            instead of resetting every Monday.

This is deliberately NOT the gradient-boosted model scoring vitals. The model
was trained on discharge-time features and contains no vitals, adherence or
pharmacy feature - it cannot score them, and pretending otherwise would be the
dishonest option. The weekly layer is therefore a transparent clinical
guardrail on top of a calibrated ML baseline, which is the standard shape for
a monitoring programme that does not yet have post-discharge outcome data of
its own to train on.

Direction of every rule: deterioration in vitals or adherence pushes risk UP,
sustained good control pushes it DOWN. Weights come from well-established
associations - a >2 kg weekly weight gain as a fluid-overload signal, the 80%
PDC threshold for adequate adherence, attended early follow-up reducing
readmission - and are recorded here rather than buried in code so a clinician
can argue with them.

The weights are deliberately ASYMMETRIC: the worst week can add about 27 points
while the best week removes about 6. Two reasons. Clinically, deterioration is
strong evidence of trouble whereas perfect adherence is only weak evidence of
safety - a patient can take every pill and still decompensate. Empirically, the
trained model behaves the same way: perturbing its lab inputs across their full
deteriorating range moved scores +10.2 points on average, while normalising the
same inputs moved them only -1.8. Fixed discharge-time features set a risk floor
that good behaviour cannot go below, and these rules preserve that floor.

WHAT IS REAL AND WHAT IS SIMULATED
----------------------------------
    REAL        the discharge score and its SHAP drivers, from the trained model
    REAL        the patient's discharge-time feature vector
    SIMULATED   the weekly vitals, adherence, pharmacy and follow-up records
    SIMULATED   which patients deteriorate

Every document carries source="simulated" and the UI labels it. Replace this
with real programme data when the feed exists; the document shape and the API
do not change.

HOW TRAJECTORIES ARE CHOSEN
---------------------------
Not from the admission's `readmit_30d` label. The worklist shows each patient's
MOST RECENT admission, and a last admission has nothing after it, so its label
is censored to 0 by construction.

Deterioration is instead drawn from the model's own calibrated discharge
probability, which is precisely what calibration licenses: a patient scored at
40% should go on to deteriorate 40% of the time. The cohort then reproduces the
real ~20% event rate AND puts the deterioration where the model expects it.
